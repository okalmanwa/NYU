                <h2 class="mt-4" id="Overview">Overview: What are Sex Selection, Genetic Analysis, and Designer Babies?
                </h2>
                <p><span>Here’s a scenario:</span> Imagine that you go to the doctor’s office and discover that you and
                    your partner
                    are going to have a baby. However, both your and your partner’s families have a strong history of
                    Down's Syndrome, with multiple family members possessing it– there is a high chance that your child
                    will inherit this disease. All of a sudden, your doctor offers you the option of altering your
                    child’s genes so that it will no longer be affected, but at a hefty price. In fact, most families
                    probably couldn’t afford to analyze and alter their baby’s genes. Would you choose to design your
                    child’s genetics?</p>
                <p>Assisted reproductive technologies offer prospective parents the ability to select their child’s sex
                    and to determine whether their prospective child will inherit a particular disease or be born with a
                    disability. Although current technology allows only for the selection of embryos that have such
                    traits, parents may soon be able to engineer their child’s genome so that he or she has certain
                    desirable traits, like better immunity to disease or higher intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>It’s important to not only study the science behind these procedures, but to understand the larger
                    implications behind such technology. There are many ethical discussions surrounding where to draw
                    the line when it comes to selecting for traits and, in the near future, engineering the genome
                    itself. Should parents be allowed to select the sex of their child? What about selecting against
                    hereditary disease? What implications would genome engineering have on society? Here, we’ll review
                    the use of biomedical technologies to “design” babies, and hopefully provide the tools needed for
                    you to have informed discussions, respectfully deliberate with peers, and form your own opinions on
                    the topic.</p>

                <h2 id="intro">Introduction: Getting started
                </h2>

                <p><span> Consider the following questions:</span>
                    Is it okay for parents to pick their child’s traits? Which traits
                    should parents be allowed to select for?

                    Run through the chart below and check which traits you think would be acceptable for parents to
                    select for, if any. Not all options are able to be selected for using today’s technology, but they
                    may be available in the future.

                <h2 id="terms">Terms and Concepts: Things to know</h2>
                <p>Before we jump into the topic’s discussion, there are some important terms you need to know to follow
                    and understand dialogue. These terms are: In vitro fertilization (IVF), Preimplantation genetic
                    screening (PGS), Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), Eugenics, Genome editing, Designer Baby,
                    and Germline Engineering.</p>
                <p><span>In vitro fertilization (IVF): </span> IVF is a method of assisted reproduction in which an egg
                    and sperm,
                    retrieved from the biological mother and father, are fertilized in a laboratory dish. (In vitro
                    literally means “in glass.”) Fertilization is the union of a sperm and an egg cell, resulting in the
                    creation of an embryo. The embryo is then created through in vitro fertilization and, depending on
                    successful cell division, is transferred and implanted into a woman’s uterus a few days later. The
                    biological mother carries her child, or a surrogate mother may do so. Usually multiple embryos are
                    created, and sometimes more than one embryo is implanted, which may result in twins, triplets, or
                    more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS): </span> PGS is the screening test that checks the
                    chromosomes of
                    cells from embryos created during IVF, before they are transferred to the uterus. PGS screens only
                    for the number of chromosomes and is used to identify chromosomal abnormalities such as Trisomy 21.
                    to identify the future baby’s sex, as the sex of a child is determined by the shape of the sex
                    chromosomes (XX for girl or XY for boy) using PGS. In this module, we discuss the ethics of PGS in
                    terms of sex-selection.
                </p>
                <p> <span>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): </span> PGD is a test in which a cell is extracted
                    from an IVF
                    embryo and then tested for specific genetic mutations associated with disease or disability before
                    it is transferred to the uterus. PGD usually takes place when a parent is a carrier of a certain
                    genetic condition and wants to implant an embryo that has not inherited the condition. Very
                    occasionally, parents use PGD to select embryos with a mutation associated with disability. In this
                    module, we discuss PGD in terms of selection against or for genetic mutations associated with
                    disease or disability. It is important to note that PGD is only able to investigate and identify
                    existing genes; it does not alter DNA.</p>
                <p><span>Eugenics:</span> Eugenics is defined as the science of improving a human population by means of
                    structured
                    breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics. Breeding is controlled,
                    as opposed to uncontrolled, when those with desired traits are encouraged to reproduce with others
                    who have the same desired traits, while those with undesirable traits are discouraged from
                    reproducing, and, in some cases, are sterilized. Eugenics was the root ideology that caused many
                    historical atrocities, including the Nazi persecution of Jews and the disabled, who were routinely
                    killed or sterilized. Breeding may also be controlled by selection of some embryos rather than
                    others or by using genome editing.</p>
                <p>
                    <span> Genome editing:</span>
                    Genome editing is the use of technology to alter the genome. Alteration can be done
                    via adding, replacing, removing, and splicing DNA bases.
                </p>
                <p> <span>Designer baby:</span> A child whose genome was engineered or edited to express a particular
                    phenotype or
                    eliminate a certain mutation associated with disease or disability.</p>
                <p><span>Germline engineering:</span> The use of genome editing techniques to alter sperm, eggs, or
                    embryos so that
                    the genetic changes become permanently encoded in the sex cells of the resulting offspring and are
                    able to be inherited by future offspring.</p>
                <p><i>Above and Beyond:</i>
                    If you have extra time, research and compare and contrast the following genome editing/engineering
                    methods: CRISPS, TALEN, and ZFNs. Genome editing can be achieved with different methods or tools, of
                    which three of the most reliable are CRISPR, TALEN, and Zinc Finger Nucleases. These three tools can
                    be used to create the same result, namely, an embryo with (or without) a particular genotype.
                    Compare the similarities and differences between each tool. How are they alike? How do they differ?
                </p>


                <h2 id="ethics">The Ethical Dilemma: Why (not)?</h2>
                <p> <span>Selecting vs Designing– What’s the difference</span> </p>
                <p>To a certain extent, humans have always had some degree of agency over the traits of their offspring
                    by choosing mates with desired phenotypes, like eye color or intelligence, and hope that their child
                    will inherit those traits. However, as we know, this does not ensure that one’s future child will
                    have those desired traits.
                </p>
                <p>When parents use IVF to have a child, they have the opportunity to use PGS or PGD. This provides a
                    level of control over the traits of one’s child that is not possible when a child is conceived
                    through intercourse. Since multiple embryos are typically created during one round of IVF, parents
                    are able to choose which among the multiple embryos to implant for pregnancy. For example, at this
                    stage, parents might choose the sex of the child, or might use PGD to determine if any embryos have
                    a genetic disorder such as Huntington’s disease or sickle cell disease. In theory, parents could
                    also select embryos on the basis of eye color, hair color, or any other genetic trait.</p>
                <p>Although it is legal in the United States, much debate surrounds sex-selection and overall trait
                    selection. PGS and PGD allow parents to choose which embryos to implant on the basis of certain
                    traits, but currently there is a moratorium on human genome editing in the U.S. Scientists might, in
                    the near future, use genome editing to delete undesirable genotypes (such as the gene for
                    sickle-cell disease) or introduce genotypes that will give rise to desired traits (such as increased
                    intelligence, height, or perfect pitch). Genome editing brings into focus the potential of germline
                    engineering of designer babies, meaning that parents can design their offspring with certain traits
                    that will then be heritable to their children’s children.</p>
                <p>Genome engineering goes beyond PGS or PGD because it gives parents the ability to introduce new
                    traits in the embryos created using IVF, rather than merely selecting among embryos. Using PGS, PGD,
                    or genome editing to select or design one’s offspring will likely result in the destruction of some
                    embryos. For example, if a parent creates five embryos during IVF, but selects to implant only two
                    of the embryos on the basis of sex (two boys, let’s say), the other three embryos may be destroyed,
                    frozen, or donated to science. Here, we will not explore the ethical issues surrounding the moral
                    status of embryos or the use of embryos in research.</p>


                <h2 id="cases">Case Studies: Some examples</h2>
                <p> <span>Case Study 1: </span> Savior Siblings: Charlie Whitaker <i>(Adapted from The Daily Mail)</i>
                </p>
                <p>From the moment <b>Charlie Whitaker</b>, age 5 at the time, began his chemotherapy treatment for
                    Diamond
                    Blackfan anemia, he was in terrible pain. DBA is a disease that prevents a person from making red
                    blood cells, and only six out of 13 children survive. He complained of excruciating pain in his eyes
                    and stomach, and soon started vomiting as a reaction to his treatment. He had to receive two to
                    three blood transfusions a week, which were incredibly painful. Charlie’s parents were distraught
                    and willing to do whatever it took to relieve their son’s pain and suffering.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors told them that their only hope was a stem cell transplant, and neither parent, or their
                    other child, Emily, was a match. Their only option left was to either find a match elsewhere, which
                    could take years, time that Charlie did not have, or have another child. The Whitakers chose to have
                    another child. But they needed to ensure that the new child would be a match for Charlie so that
                    stem cells from the new baby’s umbilical cord could be used for Charlie’s stem cell transplant. The
                    Whitakers used PGD, in combination with IVF, to select an embryo that matched Charlie’s blood type.
                    Their son, Jamie, was born nine months later. Jamie is labeled a “savior sibling,” as one of the
                    main purposes for his birth was to save his brother. Charlie received a stem cell transplant, using
                    stem cells obtained from Jamie’s umbilical cord, when he was 12, and was finally relieved from this
                    pain. Mrs. Whitaker said: “We have been open with both the boys. Jamie knows why he was born but
                    knows we would have loved him whether he was a savior sibling or not. He is a bit of a miracle and
                    he did a great thing. The boys will always have a bond because of it.”
                </p>
                <p>The whole family is very grateful for Jamie, and all of the Whitakers are now healthy and happy.
                    Jamie is said to be happy to have helped his brother and is proud to have saved him; however, he has
                    also said that “I know I was born to do that instead of being just born for me.” Thus, he can be
                    incredibly proud for being able to save his brother’s life, but he has grown up with a mindset that
                    he was born in order to accomplish something specific, not just to be himself.</p><br>
                <p>Moving on, consider these questions and how you would react in the same situation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How would you feel if you were a “savior sibling”?
                    </li>
                    <li>Do you think that it is ethically sound to have a child mainly for the purpose of being a
                        “savior sibling”?</li>
                    <li>Do you think being a “savior sibling” would be empowering or make the child feel unwanted and
                        used?
                    </li>
                    <li>Do you think that PGS or PGD should be used when parents want to have a savior sibling? Or would
                        that further the idea that the child is being designed for a particular use instead of for
                        himself/herself?</li>
                </ul>

                <p> <span>Case Study 2: Choosing Deafness</span> </p>
                <p>Sally and Ben Parker are a newly married deaf couple who are finally ready to have a child. After
                    much thinking, Sally and Ben make an appointment at an IVF clinic, because they have decided that
                    they want to select for a deaf baby using PGD. Before being able to go through with PGD, every
                    couple must meet with a genetic counselor to go over the process and to make sure that the parents
                    are truly comfortable with and aware of their actions.
                </p>
                <p>During the meeting, the counselor begins to challenge the Parkers to make sure that they fully
                    understand the consequences of using PGD, especially when selecting for a disability. The Parkers
                    argue that deafness is not a disability, and it is only deemed a disability due to societal
                    constructs and misunderstanding on the part of those who are not deaf; the disadvantages that come
                    with deafness is a product of society, not of the disability itself. Further, they believe that they
                    will be better parents to a deaf child, as they would form a stronger bond and be able to share
                    their life experiences. Their outlook on life and experiences would be irrelevant to someone who
                    does not have to face the same adversities. They brought up the fact that 3% of IVF-PGD clinics in
                    the U.S. have reported having provided PGD to couples who seek to use PGD in this manner. Therefore,
                    they are allowed, and even entitled, to use PGD this way.

                </p>
                <p>The counselor, however, does not agree, and brings up the role of a parent. A parent is supposed to
                    give his or her child the best chance in life and the most advantages possible; it would go against
                    the role of a parent to put his or her child at a disadvantage. She also points out that an unborn
                    child has no choice in the decision, and it is unfair to select for a debilitating trait for someone
                    without their consent. At the end of the day, it is not the parents’ life but the life of the child,
                    and the child should not be subject to the preferences of the parents, especially when it would
                    negatively impact the child’s life.
                </p>
                <p>The Parkers and the counselor are unable to come to an agreement, but because it is legal for the
                    Parkers to use PGD to select for deafness, they go ahead with the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, consider the following questions regarding the situation above.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you think that the parents should have authority in this situation to select for deafness?
                    </li>
                    <li>Is it morally permissible to deliberately cause a child to be deaf, which can limit the child’s
                        opportunities in life?
                    </li>
                    <li>Given that the unborn child cannot give consent to PGD, do you think that it should still be
                        allowed in cases such as these?</li>

                    <li>At what point can a line be drawn in selecting for defects or diseases? For example, would your
                        opinion change if the Parkers were anemic, and wanted their child to be anemic too? Would it be
                        okay to select for that, or even a more serious disease?</li>
                    <li>Should there be laws restricting the use of IVF and PGD to selecting only healthy embryos?</li>
                    <li>If two parents are carriers for one disease, is it morally wrong not to use PGD when having a
                        child, as without PGD, the child would have a high probability of inheriting the disease?</li>

                </ul>

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: Some food for thought</h2>
                <p>Ultimately, creating designer babies is a complex issue that brings up many questions about the
                    ethics of the human role in nature. We leave you to explore the questions in each case study module,
                    as well as the pros and cons of such technology in the ethical debates module. We’ll also leave you
