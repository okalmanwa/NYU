                <h3> Case Study 1:  Savior Siblings: Charlie Whitaker <i>(Adapted from The Daily Mail)</i>
                </h3>
                <p>From the moment <b>Charlie Whitaker</b>, age 5 at the time, began his chemotherapy treatment for
                    Diamond
                    Blackfan anemia, he was in terrible pain. DBA is a disease that prevents a person from making red
                    blood cells, and only six out of 13 children survive. He complained of excruciating pain in his eyes
                    and stomach, and soon started vomiting as a reaction to his treatment. He had to receive two to
                    three blood transfusions a week, which were incredibly painful. Charlie’s parents were distraught
                    and willing to do whatever it took to relieve their son’s pain and suffering.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors told them that their only hope was a stem cell transplant, and neither parent, or their
                    other child, Emily, was a match. Their only option left was to either find a match elsewhere, which
                    could take years, time that Charlie did not have, or have another child. The Whitakers chose to have
                    another child. But they needed to ensure that the new child would be a match for Charlie so that
                    stem cells from the new baby’s umbilical cord could be used for Charlie’s stem cell transplant. The
                    Whitakers used PGD, in combination with IVF, to select an embryo that matched Charlie’s blood type.
                    Their son, Jamie, was born nine months later. Jamie is labeled a “savior sibling,” as one of the
                    main purposes for his birth was to save his brother. Charlie received a stem cell transplant, using
                    stem cells obtained from Jamie’s umbilical cord, when he was 12, and was finally relieved from this
                    pain. Mrs. Whitaker said: “We have been open with both the boys. Jamie knows why he was born but
                    knows we would have loved him whether he was a savior sibling or not. He is a bit of a miracle and
                    he did a great thing. The boys will always have a bond because of it.”
                </p>
                <p>The whole family is very grateful for Jamie, and all of the Whitakers are now healthy and happy.
                    Jamie is said to be happy to have helped his brother and is proud to have saved him; however, he has
                    also said that “I know I was born to do that instead of being just born for me.” Thus, he can be
                    incredibly proud for being able to save his brother’s life, but he has grown up with a mindset that
                    he was born in order to accomplish something specific, not just to be himself.</p><br>
                <p>Moving on, consider these questions and how you would react in the same situation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How would you feel if you were a “savior sibling”?
                    </li>
                    <li>Do you think that it is ethically sound to have a child mainly for the purpose of being a
                        “savior sibling”?</li>
                    <li>Do you think being a “savior sibling” would be empowering or make the child feel unwanted and
                        used?
                    </li>
                    <li>Do you think that PGS or PGD should be used when parents want to have a savior sibling? Or would
                        that further the idea that the child is being designed for a particular use instead of for
                        himself/herself?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Case Study 2: Choosing Deafness </h3>
                <p>Sally and Ben Parker are a newly married deaf couple who are finally ready to have a child. After
                    much thinking, Sally and Ben make an appointment at an IVF clinic, because they have decided that
                    they want to select for a deaf baby using PGD. Before being able to go through with PGD, every
                    couple must meet with a genetic counselor to go over the process and to make sure that the parents
                    are truly comfortable with and aware of their actions.
                </p>
                <p>During the meeting, the counselor begins to challenge the Parkers to make sure that they fully
                    understand the consequences of using PGD, especially when selecting for a disability. The Parkers
                    argue that deafness is not a disability, and it is only deemed a disability due to societal
                    constructs and misunderstanding on the part of those who are not deaf; the disadvantages that come
                    with deafness is a product of society, not of the disability itself. Further, they believe that they
                    will be better parents to a deaf child, as they would form a stronger bond and be able to share
                    their life experiences. Their outlook on life and experiences would be irrelevant to someone who
                    does not have to face the same adversities. They brought up the fact that 3% of IVF-PGD clinics in
                    the U.S. have reported having provided PGD to couples who seek to use PGD in this manner. Therefore,
                    they are allowed, and even entitled, to use PGD this way.

                </p>
                <p>The counselor, however, does not agree, and brings up the role of a parent. A parent is supposed to
                    give his or her child the best chance in life and the most advantages possible; it would go against
                    the role of a parent to put his or her child at a disadvantage. She also points out that an unborn
                    child has no choice in the decision, and it is unfair to select for a debilitating trait for someone
                    without their consent. At the end of the day, it is not the parents’ life but the life of the child,
                    and the child should not be subject to the preferences of the parents, especially when it would
                    negatively impact the child’s life.
                </p>
                <p>The Parkers and the counselor are unable to come to an agreement, but because it is legal for the
                    Parkers to use PGD to select for deafness, they go ahead with the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, consider the following questions regarding the situation above.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you think that the parents should have authority in this situation to select for deafness?
                    </li>
                    <li>Is it morally permissible to deliberately cause a child to be deaf, which can limit the child’s
                        opportunities in life?
                    </li>
                    <li>Given that the unborn child cannot give consent to PGD, do you think that it should still be
                        allowed in cases such as these?</li>

                    <li>At what point can a line be drawn in selecting for defects or diseases? For example, would your
                        opinion change if the Parkers were anemic, and wanted their child to be anemic too? Would it be
                        okay to select for that, or even a more serious disease?</li>
                    <li>Should there be laws restricting the use of IVF and PGD to selecting only healthy embryos?</li>
                    <li>If two parents are carriers for one disease, is it morally wrong not to use PGD when having a
                        child, as without PGD, the child would have a high probability of inheriting the disease?</li>

                </ul>
