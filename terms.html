                <h2 id="terms">Terms and Concepts: Things to know</h2>
                <p>Before we jump into the topic’s discussion, there are some important terms you need to know to follow
                    and understand dialogue. These terms are: In vitro fertilization (IVF), Preimplantation genetic
                    screening (PGS), Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), Eugenics, Genome editing, Designer Baby,
                    and Germline Engineering.</p>
                <p><span>In vitro fertilization (IVF): </span> IVF is a method of assisted reproduction in which an egg
                    and sperm,
                    retrieved from the biological mother and father, are fertilized in a laboratory dish. (In vitro
                    literally means “in glass.”) Fertilization is the union of a sperm and an egg cell, resulting in the
                    creation of an embryo. The embryo is then created through in vitro fertilization and, depending on
                    successful cell division, is transferred and implanted into a woman’s uterus a few days later. The
                    biological mother carries her child, or a surrogate mother may do so. Usually multiple embryos are
                    created, and sometimes more than one embryo is implanted, which may result in twins, triplets, or
                    more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS): </span> PGS is the screening test that checks the
                    chromosomes of
                    cells from embryos created during IVF, before they are transferred to the uterus. PGS screens only
                    for the number of chromosomes and is used to identify chromosomal abnormalities such as Trisomy 21.
                    to identify the future baby’s sex, as the sex of a child is determined by the shape of the sex
                    chromosomes (XX for girl or XY for boy) using PGS. In this module, we discuss the ethics of PGS in
                    terms of sex-selection.
                </p>
                <p> <span>Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): </span> PGD is a test in which a cell is extracted
                    from an IVF
                    embryo and then tested for specific genetic mutations associated with disease or disability before
                    it is transferred to the uterus. PGD usually takes place when a parent is a carrier of a certain
                    genetic condition and wants to implant an embryo that has not inherited the condition. Very
                    occasionally, parents use PGD to select embryos with a mutation associated with disability. In this
                    module, we discuss PGD in terms of selection against or for genetic mutations associated with
                    disease or disability. It is important to note that PGD is only able to investigate and identify
                    existing genes; it does not alter DNA.</p>
                <p><span>Eugenics:</span> Eugenics is defined as the science of improving a human population by means of
                    structured
                    breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics. Breeding is controlled,
                    as opposed to uncontrolled, when those with desired traits are encouraged to reproduce with others
                    who have the same desired traits, while those with undesirable traits are discouraged from
                    reproducing, and, in some cases, are sterilized. Eugenics was the root ideology that caused many
                    historical atrocities, including the Nazi persecution of Jews and the disabled, who were routinely
                    killed or sterilized. Breeding may also be controlled by selection of some embryos rather than
                    others or by using genome editing.</p>
                <p>
                    <span> Genome editing:</span>
                    Genome editing is the use of technology to alter the genome. Alteration can be done
                    via adding, replacing, removing, and splicing DNA bases.
                </p>
                <p> <span>Designer baby:</span> A child whose genome was engineered or edited to express a particular
                    phenotype or
                    eliminate a certain mutation associated with disease or disability.</p>
                <p><span>Germline engineering:</span> The use of genome editing techniques to alter sperm, eggs, or
                    embryos so that
                    the genetic changes become permanently encoded in the sex cells of the resulting offspring and are
                    able to be inherited by future offspring.</p>
                <p><i>Above and Beyond:</i>
                    If you have extra time, research and compare and contrast the following genome editing/engineering
                    methods: CRISPS, TALEN, and ZFNs. Genome editing can be achieved with different methods or tools, of
                    which three of the most reliable are CRISPR, TALEN, and Zinc Finger Nucleases. These three tools can
                    be used to create the same result, namely, an embryo with (or without) a particular genotype.
                    Compare the similarities and differences between each tool. How are they alike? How do they differ?
                </p>
